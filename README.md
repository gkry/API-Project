# API-Project
The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic, web-based chart of API data that has the ability to change over time as the data changes. My project uses two API's. The first one is from NYC Open data that retrieves the data used in my chart. The second is from image-charts and is responsible for generating both charts using the data retrieved by the first API. My project uses data from the Business Integrity Commission regarding waste management violations. My image-chart API extracts the data I want to display, which is the number of violations per borough in the state of New York. The pie chart was chosen because boroughs are pieces of a whole, and this shows which boroughs are the largest contributors. The bar graph shows how it trends, making it easier to recognize patterns.
